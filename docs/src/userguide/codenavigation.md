# Code Navigation

## Quick File Navigation

> **Tip**: You can open any file by its name when you type `Ctrl+P` **(Quick Open)**.

When you are working on a task, you will find yourself quickly jumping between the same set of files. You can use two powerful commands to navigate in and across files with easy-to-use key bindings.

Hold `Ctrl` and press `Tab` to view a list of all files open in an editor group. To open one of these files, use `Tab` again to pick the file you want to navigate to, then release `Ctrl` to open it.

Alternatively, you can use `Alt+Left` and `Alt+Right` to navigate between files and edit locations. If you are jumping around between different lines of the same file, these shortcuts allow you to navigate between those locations easily.
